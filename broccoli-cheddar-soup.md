# Broccoli Cheddar Soup

This shit's amazing. Kind of like Panera's stuff, but better. Best served with a side of crusty bread for dipping. 

## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 chopped onion
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 cups half-and-half
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 3-4 whole bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A bunch of broccoli
- 2 diced carrots
- 1 block of grated white cheddar cheese
- 1/2 bag of grated yellow cheddar cheese

## Directions

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook about 3 minutes. 

Whisk in flour and cook until golden, usually 3-4 minutes. 

Whisk in half-and-half, chicken broth, bay leaves, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and let cook about 10-15 minutes. 

Chop and clean broccoli and carrots. 

**Remove the bay leaves.**

Add broccoli and carrots to the pot. Let cook about 15-20 minutes. 

Grate the cheese as needed.

Remove pot from stove and use immersion blender to puree the veggies in the soup. 

Add cheese and mix until melted. 

Serve and enjoy.
